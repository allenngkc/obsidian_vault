Scientists are able to see individual atoms through a special microscope called scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). The STM passes an extremely fine, electrically charged needle over the surface of an object.

In an atom, the nucleus makes up most of the mass, and it's the densest part of the atom. However electrons makes up most volume of the atom, since they flows around.
