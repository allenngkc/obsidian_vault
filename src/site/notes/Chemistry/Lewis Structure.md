When drawing a Lewis Structure of a compound or molecule. There are few types of structures

> When considering double bonds or triple bonds, atoms with lower $EN$ tends to share them first

#### Coordinate Covalent Bond

One atom supplies both electrons for the bond, where N gives 2 electrons to bond with $H+$

#### Resonance Structure

It is not one and the atom foes not "flip" back and forth, It's a combo of both molecules
> Atoms stay in place, electron change locations

#### Expanded Octet

This happens where the central atom takes more than 8 electrons
See below $PCI_{5}$, P is taking 10 electrons

If this happens, the central atom is larger than Ne, and there are no multiple bonds to central atom. These are called **overfilled octet**, there are also **underfilled octet**
