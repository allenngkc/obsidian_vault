##### In reference to explaining transformation, we use the following equation.
$$y=af(k(x-d)) + c$$
In this situation, f represents the [[Base Functions\|Base Functions]]

> If a < 0: Vertical reflection in the x-axis
> If |a| > 1: Vertical stretch by a factor of |a|
> If 0 < |a| < 1: Vertical compression by a factor of |a|

> If k < 0: Horizontal reflection in the y-axis
> If |k| > 1: Horizontal compression by a factor of 1/|k|
> If 0 < |k| < 1: Horizontal Stretch by a factor of 1/|k|

> If d > 0: Horizontal translation right d units
> If d < 0: Horizontal translation left d units

> If c > 0: Vertical translation up c units
> If c < 0: Vertical translation down c units

>[!tip] Make sure to change 2x+10 into 2(x+5) so that we don't mess up k and d


We can obtain new $(x,y)$ values of transformed functions, we denote this mapping as
$$(x, y) = (\frac{1}{k}x+d, ay+c)$$
