In Geometric Vector, which characteristics are defined in [[Math/Vectors\|Vectors]]. We define directions with compass bearings.

To represent a geometric vector algebraically, position the tail of the vector at the origin of a Cartesian xy-plane.

Here we have the direction of $v$, as $45\deg$ from positive x-axis

#### The Vector Dot Product

we have the following formula

$$a\cdot b = |a||b|cos\theta$$
$$cos\theta=\frac{a\cdot b}{|a||b|}$$
or we have:

$$a\cdot b=[a_{1}b_{1}] + [a_{2}b_{2}]+[a_{3}b_{3}]$$
Dot product returns a single number.

>  For any orthogonal vectors: $a\cdot b=0$, where the $\theta$ is $90\deg$, thus $a\cdot b=0$ 

##### Getting $\vec{AB}$ from $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$

Suppose $A=(2, 3, 1)$, $B=(4,0,-2)$, then $\vec{AB} = (4-2, 0-3, -2-1)$

##### Finding perpendicular vector

when working with 3-D vectors, often a simple way is to swap the components and negate one of them. For example, we have $(-3,2,4)$, the other vector would be $(-2,-3,0)$. Since their product is 0

##### Position Vector

> Any vectors with tail at origin is called a position vector

##### Unit Vector

> Any vectors with a magnitude of 1
### Vectors in Three Dimensions

Consider an extra z direction from our existing x-y cartesian plane.

Suppose a sketch, and our problem is to find the magnitude of $\vec{OP}$

If I want to find the magnitude of $\vec{OQ}$, since it's the hypotenuse of a right triangle on the $xy$ plane. So

$$|\vec{OQ}|^2=3^2+5^2$$

Therefore, we have $|\vec{OQ}|=\sqrt{3^2+5^2}=\sqrt{34}$

Now, $|\vec{OP}|^2=|\vec{OQ}|^2+|\vec{PQ}|^2$, $|\vec{OP}|=\sqrt{3^2+5^2+4^2}=\sqrt{50}=5\sqrt{2}$

So in conclusion, we proved that in general if $\vec{u}=(a,b,c)$, then $|\vec{u}|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}$

##### Finding Angles in 3 Dimensional Vectors

Suppose we have $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$. As angles of $x,y,z$ respectively.
