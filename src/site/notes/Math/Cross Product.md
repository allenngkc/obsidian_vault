A vector that's orthogonal to 2 vectors, according to rule hand rule with index finger pointing first vector.

It's important to know that
$$\vec{a}\times\vec{b} \neq \vec{b}\times\vec{a},\vec{b}\times\vec{a}=-(\vec{a}\times\vec{b})$$

>1st vector: "index finger"
>2nd vector: "3 other fingers"
>resultant: thumb

#### Equations:

$$|\vec{a}\times\vec{b}|=|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|sin\theta$$
$$\vec{a}\times\vec{b}=[a_{2}b_{3} - a_{3}b_{2}, a_{3}b_{1}-a_{1}b_{3}, a_{1}b_{2}-a_{2}b_{1} ]$$
