While the standard quadratic form is ax^2 + bx + c. The vertex form are as follows:
$$y=a(x-h)^2+k$$
$$vertex(h,k)$$
A vertex in a quadratic function is the point where the rate of change of the function is zero, in other words, it's the maximum or minimum point in a parabola

##### Finding the vertex from standard form

From the standard form: $$ax^2+bx+c$$
We have following formula to find the vertex: $$(-\frac{b}{2a},-\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a})$$
##### Converting vertex form to standard form

Example process: $$y=x^2+14x-9$$$$y=(x^2+14x)-9$$
$$y=(x^2+7x+49)-49-9$$
$$y=(x+7)^2-58$$
> Now the vertex is (h,k) (-7, -58)
