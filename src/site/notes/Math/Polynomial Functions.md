A polynomial function is a function whose equation is defined by a polynomial in one variable. The general form is as follows

$$f(x)=a_{n}x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{1}x+a_{0}$$
where the numerical coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2,...,a_n$, are real numbers, and the exponents of x are **non-negative integers**.

> Don't get wrong with [[Math/Even and Odd Function\|Even and Odd Function]]
> An odd poly function must have an odd amount of x-intercepts (must pass through origin)

#### Polynomial Functions in Factored Form

We can obtain the order of roots and x-intercepts from factored form
$$f(x)=-x(x+2)^3(x-3)^2$$
Now the exponents of the brackets represents the **order of roots** $(-2,0),(0,0),(3,0)$

#### Polynomial Function End Behaviors

Even Degree with + Leading coefficient = Q2 -> Q1
Even Degree with - Leading coefficient = Q3 -> Q4
Odd Degree with + Leading coefficient = Q3 ->Q1
Odd Degree with - Leading coefficient = Q2 -> Q4

##### Symmetry in Polynomials

1. If a function is symmetric on the y-axis, then it's a even function and $f(-x)=f(x)$
2. If a function is symmetric on the origin, where $f(-x)=-f(x)$, then it's odd function
>	Function is unchanged when rotated 180 about the origin

#### Terminology

$a_n$ is the leading coefficient, the highest degree term in a polynomial

###### Even Degree vs. Odd Degree

If the value of the highest exponent of x is even, then it's even degree polynomial function
Constant (degree 0), Quadratic (degree 2), quartic (degree 4)

If the value of the highest exponent of x is odd, then it's odd degree polynomial function
Linear functions of degree 1, Cubic (degree 3), Quintic (degree 5)

##### Turning Points

The maximum turning point of a polynomial function is the highest degree term - 1

They are usually local absolute max or min points

> To determine the possible number of turning points, keep in mind it's end behavior

Even Degree Functions
> Minimum turning points = 1

Odd Degree Functions
> Minimum turning points = 0

##### X-Intercept

The maximum number of x-intercepts is the highest degree term
The minimum number of x-intercepts depends on the function quadrants traversal

#### Finite Differences

For a polynomial function of degree $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, the $n^{th}$ differences

1. are equal
2. have the same sign as the leading coefficient
3. are equal to $a*n!$, where a is the leading coefficient, n is the highest degree

$$\vec\Delta^ny=a*n!*(\vec\Delta x)^n$$
When $\vec\Delta x = 1$, then $\vec\Delta^n y=a*n!$
