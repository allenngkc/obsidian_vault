We define $i^2$ = $-1$

A complex number consists of a real and imaginary part:
$$\mathbb{Z} = 5+3i$$

> We have a imaginary part as the y-axis, real part as the x-axis

### Converting Complex Numbers to Polar Coordinates

Suppose we have $z=3+i\sqrt{3}$, we obtain the magnitude by using the pyth thm

$z=\sqrt{12}(cos(\frac{\pi}{6})+isin(\frac{\pi}{6})$


### Complex Exponentiation

For a complex number $z=x+iy$, we have:
$$e^{x+iy}=e^{x}(cosy+isiny)$$
$$e^{z}=e^{x+iy}=e^{x}e^{iy}=e^x(cosy+isiny)$$
The function $e^z$ is surjective with the following co-domain
$$e^z:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}/\{0\}$$
We have the famous sequence of $e^{i\pi}+1=0$


#### de Moivre's Theorem

$$(cos\theta + i sin\theta)^n=cosn\theta+isinn\theta$$
